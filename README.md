# Convolutional-Neural-Network-with-CUDA
Overview
In this milestone, I focused on optimizing the forward convolution operation in a convolutional neural network. The optimizations aimed to reduce execution time and improve performance by using various techniques such as CUDA streams, FP16 precision, and constant memory.

Optimization 1: CUDA Streams
To introduce concurrency into host-side CUDA operations, I implemented CUDA streams. This optimization enables overlapping data transfers and kernel execution, leading to reduced execution time. The key idea was to utilize multiple streams to keep the GPU engaged, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

After implementing the streams, the program execution time was significantly reduced compared to the baseline. Memory operations and kernel execution times also improved, showing a reduction in overall time for CUDA memory copy operations and kernel execution.

Optimization 2: FP16 Half Precision
The second optimization involved using FP16 (half precision) arithmetic instead of the standard FP32 (single precision) to perform the convolution operations. The expectation was that FP16 would offer faster computation and better memory efficiency, as it uses less bandwidth compared to FP32.

However, the performance of this optimization did not meet expectations. Profiling results indicated slower runtimes compared to the baseline, likely due to the overhead introduced by data type conversions during kernel execution and suboptimal memory bandwidth usage.

Optimization 3: Constant Memory
The final optimization focused on storing the convolution filter in constant memory, a read-only memory type on the GPU. This technique leverages the GPU's caching mechanisms, providing faster data access than global memory. Since the convolution mask is not modified during execution, it is a suitable candidate for constant memory.

This optimization resulted in faster read access to the mask, improving the overall performance of the convolution operation.

Conclusion
The CUDA streams optimization showed significant improvements in performance, while the FP16 optimization did not yield the expected benefits due to issues with memory bandwidth and data conversion overhead. The constant memory optimization successfully improved performance by enhancing memory access efficiency.

Overall, the optimizations helped streamline the convolution operation, and their combined effect led to a more efficient convolutional neural network implementation.
